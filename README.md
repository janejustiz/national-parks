# NationalParks

Welcome! This gem scrapes the National Park's website to tell you about the national parks in a particular state or territory.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'national_parks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install national_parks

## Usage

It allows you to enter a state or territory (in USPS Abbreviation form) and get a list of national parks in that state. If you are interested in learning more about a specific park, you enter it's number and you get a description of the park. If you are unsure of what state/territory you want to chose from or don't know the appropriate USPS Abbreviation, you can receive a list of options.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
